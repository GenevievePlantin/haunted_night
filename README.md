# Haunted Night

Haunted night is a game made for Hacktoberfest.
We want to do a sort of side scroller with depth, more like a depth scoller.
The main caracter will make a journey throught the dark forest and fight his fears.

## About the project

This game will be coded with Angular.
However, we want to use Grunt to compile Sass, to minify the js files, to setup the server Express.js and to run unit tests.

## Requirements + set up

Install nodeJS version 4.6.0

Install npm version 3.10.7
  * `npm install -g npm@3.10.7` if npm was installed with nodeJS

Run `npm install` in the root of this project repository

Run `grunt test` to generate all sources and to launch Express server

Go to `localhost:3001` to see the application

## Troubleshoot

To remove the EventEmitter memory leak warning
do a "npm install -g npm@next"
