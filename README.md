# Haunted Night

Haunted night is a game made for Hacktoberfest.

We want to do a sort of side scroller with depth, more like a depth scoller.

The main caracter will make a journey throught the dark forest and fight his fears.

## Set up

This game will be coded with Angular.

However, we want to use Grunt to compile Sass, to minify the js files, to setup the server Express,js and to run unit tests.
